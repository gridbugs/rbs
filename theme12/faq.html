      <h2><a name="what_is_dress_circle"></a>What is the "Dress Circle"?</h2>

          <p>The Dress Circle is a seating area in the Science Theatre which is located directly above the Stalls. The Dress Circle offers a great vantage point of not only the show, but also a behind-the-scenes look at the Tech desk controlling all the lights and sounds of the show.</p>


      <h2><a name="sales_desk">Where is the Sales Desk?</a></h2>
      <p>The Sales Desk is set up at the Library Lawn, in front of the UNSW Library and at the Quad Lawn, in front of the Arc Store.</p>
      <p>It is available 12pm - 2pm, Monday to Friday, Weeks 8-10 (10th - 28th September).</p>
      <p>If you can't find the Desk, contact the <a href="#contact">Sales Team</a>.</p>

      <h2><a name="contact_details">Why do you need my contact details?</a></h2>

      <p>We need your email address so that we can send you confirmation details and any other essential information with regards to your ticket purchases.</p>

      <p>We need your contact number so that we can contact you in case you haven't picked up your ticket by 7.30pm on the night. If we cannot reach you, we may resell your ticket after 7.45pm.</p>

      <h2><a name="resell_tickets">What happens if I'm running late or can no longer come?</a></h2>

      <p>If you're running late on the night, please call our <a href="#contact">Sales Team</a> to let us know you're still coming. If we cannot reach you on the contact number provided, we may resell your ticket after 7.45pm.</p>

      <p>If you're no longer able to come see the show, please let us know so we can give your seat to someone waiting.</p>

      <h2><a name="reserve_tickets">Can I just reserve tickets and pay for them later?</a></h2>

      <p>Unfortunately, no. However, special arrangements can be made for <a href="#group_bookings">group bookings</a> of 15 or more people.</p>

      <h2><a name="group_bookings">Can I make group bookings?</a></h2>

      <p>Yes, of course! Group bookings allow you to reserve seats for your group, then pay for and collect tickets on the night.</p>

      <p>Group bookings of 15 people or more will receive a discounted ticket price of $10 each (and $9 on opening night!) Please note this discount only applies to groups that are in one booking and the discount must be arranged with the show organisers prior to the day of the performance.</p>

      <p>If you'd like to make a group booking, please email the <a href="#contact">Sales Team</a>.</p>

      <h2><a name="collecting">I've paid for my ticket(s) - How do I collect them?</a></h2>

      <p>Any ticket(s) booked online can be collected at the door on the night, or from the <a href="#sales_desk">Sales Desk</a>.</p>

      <h2><a name="sold_out">I'm trying to buy a ticket, but it looks like you're sold out!</a></h2>

      <p>Never fear! There are a number of tickets set aside for each night to be sold at the door. 
      Just make your way to the theatre earlier on the night (the ticketing desk opens at 7pm), you should be able to purchase tickets for the night then. Please note that there are only a limited number of such tickets per night though, so try to get there early! :)</p>

      <h2><a name="contact">How do I contact the Sales Team?</a></h2>

      <p>If you have any enquiries, please contact the Sales Team.</p>

      <p>You can email them at <a href="mailto:tickets@cserevue.org.au">tickets@cserevue.org.au</a> or call them on a number which will be available here soon!</p>
